# Digital Twin-Based Health Monitoring of DC Motor (PBL2)

## Project Objective
This project aims to develop a simplified Digital Twin model for monitoring the health of a DC motor using operational data such as temperature, current, and speed.

## Current Progress
- Generated synthetic dataset representing DC motor parameters
- Injected anomalies to simulate faults
- Implemented baseline anomaly detection logic in Python
- Validated the data pipeline using Google Colab

## Future Work
- Replace synthetic data with real sensor data
- Integrate microcontroller-based data acquisition
- Develop a visualization dashboard for monitoring

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Google Colab
